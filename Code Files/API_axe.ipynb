They might be aware of this specific issue and could provide a solution or workaround.\\n3. **MathJax Configuration:** Review MathJax's documentation or forums for any known issues or configuration settings that might specifically improve JAWS compatibility.\\n4. **Community Forums:** Reach out to accessibility forums or communities. Other users might have encountered and solved this exact problem.\\n\\nI'm sorry I couldn't provide a direct solution to your issue. If there's anything more I can help with or another topic you're curious about, feel free to ask!\\n\\n### Further Reading\\n\\n- [The Math Role](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/custom-widgets/concepts/role/math)\\n\\nWishing you the best of luck in resolving this issue, and kudos for your efforts in making math content accessible! üåü\"]"

Happy learning! \\ud83d\\udcda\",\n          \"Hello Mike,\\n\\nIt sounds like you're encountering quite a specific challenge with JAWS and MathML content, especially when using MathJax. Based on the information from Deque University about **The Math Role**, it's noted that screen reader support for math, including MathML, is still evolving and varies across different platforms and readers. Specifically, it mentions that neither JAWS nor NVDA support native MathML as robustly as we might hope. However, utilities like MathJax can indeed improve the rendering of MathML across browsers, which is beneficial for screen reader users to a certain extent.\\n\\nGiven your detailed description, it appears you've encountered a limitation or bug with JAWS's handling of MathML, even when MathJax is employed to enhance compatibility. While Deque University doesn't provide a direct solution for the JAWS issue you're experiencing, your best course of action might involve a few steps:\\n\\n1. **Check for Updates:** Ensure that both JAWS and MathJax are running on their latest versions, as updates might include fixes for such issues.\\n2. **Contact Support:** Reach out to both the Freedom Scientific (the creators of JAWS) and the MathJax team. Detailing your issue to them could provide you with specific workarounds or inform you about upcoming fixes.\\n3. **Community Forums:** Sometimes, other users might have encountered similar issues and could offer practical solutions or scripts that they've used to resolve the problem.\\n\\nIt's also worth exploring if there are any additional configurations or attributes within MathJax that might influence how JAWS interprets and outputs MathML content. Sometimes, specific settings or tweaks can make a significant difference in accessibility support.\\n\\nI understand this might not be the clear-cut solution you were hoping for, but given the complexities of screen reader support for MathML, these steps could help you navigate towards a more satisfactory resolution.\\n\\n### Further Reading\\n\\n- [The Math Role](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/custom-widgets/concepts/role/math)\\n\\nShould you have any more questions or need further assistance with accessibility topics, feel free to reach out. Good luck, and I hope you find a resolution soon!\",\n          \"Good morning! \\u2600\\ufe0f\\n\\nIt sounds like you're encountering an issue with JAWS reading MathML content, particularly with MathJax. While the information you've provided about the JAWS 2024 update and its new features for reading math content and describing photos is incredibly insightful, I'd like to offer some additional context and guidance based on the information from Deque University.\\n\\n### Understanding JAWS and MathML Support\\n\\nAccording to Deque University, screen reader support for math, including MathML content, is still evolving. Specifically, for JAWS, it's noted that native MathML support is not as robust as it could be. However, utilities like MathJax can improve the rendering of MathML across browsers, making it more accessible to screen readers. This aligns with your use of MathJax for MathML math, which is a good practice. However, it's important to ensure that it's implemented in a way that works well with screen readers ([\\\"The Math Role\\\"](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/custom-widgets/concepts/role/math)).\\n\\n### JAWS Early Adopter Program\\n\\nRegarding the JAWS 2024 update you mentioned, it's fascinating to hear about the new features being introduced, such as the ability to read math content more effectively and the Picture Smart feature for describing photos. While the specific details of these features aren't covered in the Deque University materials I have access to, it's clear that Freedom Scientific (the developers of JAWS) is continually working to enhance the accessibility and functionality of their software.\\n\\n### Recommendations and Next Steps\\n\\n1. **Ensure MathJax Implementation is Optimized**: Since you're already using MathJax, review its implementation to ensure it's optimized for screen reader accessibility. This might involve checking the MathJax configuration and ensuring that it's up to date.\\n\\n2. **Explore JAWS 2024 Features**: As you suggested, exploring the new features in JAWS 2024, including the early adopter program options for reading math content, could provide a solution to the issue you're experiencing.\\n\\n3. **Feedback to Freedom Scientific**: If the problem persists, consider providing feedback to Freedom Scientific about the specific issues you're facing with MathML content and JAWS. They might offer additional insights or solutions.\\n\\n4. **Community Engagement**: Engaging with online forums or communities focused on accessibility might also provide additional insights from others who have encountered and resolved similar issues.\\n\\n### Further Reading\\n\\n- [The Math Role](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/custom-widgets/concepts/role/math)\\n\\nI hope this information is helpful, Dean!

Your curiosity about customizing radio buttons and checkboxes for better aesthetics while maintaining accessibility is a concern shared by many in the web development community.\\n\\n### Custom Designs for Accessibility\\n\\nAccording to Deque University, it's indeed possible to create custom widgets like radio buttons and checkboxes that are both attractive and accessible. The key is to ensure these custom controls behave exactly like their native HTML counterparts, especially for screen reader users and those who rely on keyboard navigation. \\n\\nFor instance, Deque University provides examples of ARIA radio buttons and checkboxes that are designed to act exactly like native controls. These custom controls are accessible as long as they are coded correctly to mimic the behavior of native HTML radio buttons and checkboxes ([Custom Radio Buttons and Groups](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/custom-widgets/examples/radio), [Custom Checkboxes](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/custom-widgets/examples/checkbox)). This includes ensuring that the checked or unchecked state of each option is communicated properly by screen readers and that keyboard navigation works as expected.\\n\\n### CSS `appearance: none`\\n\\nRegarding the CSS technique of using `appearance: none` to customize the appearance of form elements, while this can indeed create opportunities for standardizing the look of controls across platforms, it's crucial to remember that accessibility should not be compromised. When implementing custom styles, developers must ensure that the essential functionality and accessibility of these controls are preserved. This means that custom-styled controls should still be fully operable and understandable by users of assistive technologies.\\n\\n### Developer and QA Notes\\n\\nWhen developing custom-styled checkboxes and radio buttons, it's also important to consider visual styling in high-contrast modes. For example, ensuring that the method used to visually mark the checkbox or radio button as selected or not selected is visible in Windows High Contrast Mode is crucial. Using an `<img>` element or a font icon in the CSS are methods that work visually and are recommended by Deque University ([Developer and QA Notes for Custom Checkboxes](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/custom-widgets/examples/checkbox)).\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nIn summary, while custom designs for radio buttons and checkboxes can certainly appeal to web designers and developers aiming for a cohesive and visually appealing interface, it's essential to implement these customizations with accessibility in mind. By adhering to best practices and guidelines, such as those provided by Deque University, it's possible to achieve both attractive and accessible web components.\\n\\nIs there anything else I can assist you with?

Happy learning! \\ud83d\\udcda\",\n          \"Hello Evan,\\n\\nIt's fantastic to hear about your commitment to enhancing accessibility in online education at the College of the Redwoods! Your proactive approach to learning about screen readers to review digital resources is commendable. Let's dive into your questions to get you and your colleagues started on this journey. \\ud83d\\ude80\\n\\n### Is there a screen reader - or screen readers - that we should focus on?\\n\\nAccording to Deque University, while it's not required to use more than one screen reader for testing, it is recommended to use at least two due to differences in behavior between assistive technologies. For testing PDF accessibility, NVDA (Windows) and JAWS (Windows) are particularly recommended. NVDA is a free, open-source option, and JAWS, while paid, is widely used in professional settings. Testing PDF accessibility on Mac using VoiceOver or on mobile devices is not the best idea because of limitations with PDFs. Therefore, focusing on NVDA and JAWS for Windows would be a strategic choice ([Assistive Technology](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/pdf/tagged/tools-review-assess/assistive-technology)).\\n\\n### Can you recommend training resources to help us develop proficiency?\\n\\nAbsolutely! To build proficiency with screen readers, Deque University offers a range of resources that can be incredibly helpful. For a start, you might find the Screen Reader Reference Guides very useful. These guides provide shortcuts and gestures for common screen readers, including NVDA and JAWS, which can be a great way to get accustomed to navigating with these tools. Additionally, Deque University courses like Web Accessibility Testing: Basic Methods and Tools, Web Accessibility Testing: Screen Readers, and WCAG Conformance Testing, Detailed Methodology offer detailed guidance on manual testing with screen readers, which could be invaluable for your learning process ([Screen Reader Resources](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/testing/basic-testing-routine/screen-reader-resources)).\\n\\n### Are we thinking about this correctly?\\n\\nYes, Evan, you're definitely on the right track! Understanding and effectively using screen readers is a crucial component of reviewing and ensuring the accessibility of digital resources. Your approach to learning about and utilizing these tools not only aligns with best practices but also demonstrates a commitment to inclusivity and accessibility in education. Your willingness to seek out the right tools and training resources is exactly the kind of initiative that can lead to meaningful improvements in accessibility.\\n\\n### Further Reading\\n\\n- [Assistive Technology](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/pdf/tagged/tools-review-assess/assistive-technology)\\n- [Screen Reader Resources](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/testing/basic-testing-routine/screen-reader-resources)\\n\\nEvan, your initiative is a shining example of how to make digital learning more accessible and inclusive.
